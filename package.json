  "description": "## Requirements  <br> With your team, you’ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem.

You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.",
